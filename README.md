This project unfolds in three distinct phases. In the initial phase, we meticulously conduct data cleaning and engage in comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Following this, in the second phase, we employ and assess the performance of five distinct machine learning algorithms, thereby determining the most effective approach for our specific dataset.

Lastly, in the third and final phase, we culminate this project by crafting a user-friendly interface. 
This interface seamlessly integrates with our dataset and machine learning model, providing a user-centric experience. 
Furthermore, we meticulously document the entirety of the project to ensure transparency and clarity in our approach and findings.
